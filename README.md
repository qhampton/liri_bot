Problem: Builiding a terminal assistant to locate concert, song, and movie data.

##How It Works:
* Call within terminal the liri file. 
* This will prompt questions to the user:
  * The commant they want to run.
  * The specific serch term.
 * This will go through the specific function you called and pull the data about the term requested.
